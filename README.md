 Requirements :

- JMF

- JDK

- Netbeans (to edit/compile source)

TROUBLESHOOT : 

if having trouble running jar, copy jmf.jar and sound.jar from JMF lib folder to (Installed JRE Folder)\lib\ext\

ex: C:\Program Files\java\jre6\lib\ext\

Do the same thing to JDK, copy jmf.jar and sound.jar to (installed JDK)\jre\lib\ext\

ex: C:\Program Files\java\jdk~\jre\lib\ext\

need to to install JMF first to run properly
